# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO SITE
A simple portfolio site that I quickly put together when I was bored. Playing around a bit with SCSS.

## DEVELOPMENT

* Build the website as you normally would do.
* Write all CSS in the `./scss/`-folder.
* Compile the SCSS-files using `npm run sass` / (`sass --watch ./scss/main.scss ./dist/css/main.css`)
* ???
* ???
* PROFIT

## BUILT WITH

* [SCSS] (https://sass-lang.com) - CSS preprocessor used
* [jQuery] (https://jquery.com) - JS-lib used
