# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO SITE
A simple portfolio site that I quickly put together when I was bored. Playing around a bit with SCSS.

## CODE

* `./dist/..` contains the main-code that is viewed in the browser.
* `./scss/..` contains the raw SCSS-files.
* `.README.md` contains this README.md that you are currently reading.

## DEVELOPMENT

* Build the website as you normally would do.
* Write all CSS in the `./scss/`-folder.
* Compile the SCSS-files using `npm run sass` / (`sass --watch ./scss/main.scss ./dist/css/main.css`)
* ???
* ???
* PROFIT

## BUILT WITH

* [SCSS] (https://sass-lang.com) - CSS preprocessor used.
* [jQuery] (https://jquery.com) - JS-lib used.
* [NPM] (https://nodejs.org) - Package Manager used.
